Data Binding Techniques in Angular(Data sharing in components)
-------------------------------------------------------

html-- view
ts  -- component


1. One way Binding
-------------------
1.1  component to view data sharing
    1.1.1  STRING INTERPOLLATION  {{}}
        to display string directly from ts to html .
    1.1.2 property binding        [property]=""
        if we want to share data from ts to view as avalue of any property, then 
        attribute/prpperty name will be given inside the'[]' 
1.2  view to component data sharing
    1.2.1  event binding (event)="method()"
              the event will be specified in the view and when that event is woking whichever event is to be called 
              will be invoked.

    1.2.2  event binding using $event(event)=method($event)
                if we want to access any data/value from the html page along with the event we can use this 
    1.2.3  Event binding with template rendering variable #varia                    

2. Two Way Binding
-------------------

    2.1 ngModel       [ngModel]="property"     FormsModule (import tz library)

Redirection in Angular
-----------------------
Module -- AppRoutingModule
Router -- a class used to redirect                     dashboard=package   dashboard.component.css=module  
methods-- navigateByUrl                          inside package->module->class->methods 


Dependency Injection
---------------------
to share data from one class to another class.it is done inside constructor. for that we require 2 
access specifiers

1.private -- can be used only within the specified class
2.public  -- can be used  within that package
inside constructor
access_specifiers reference:ClassName
to call----- reference.method

Angular Services
----------------
to store redentent data and methods
-all the components can access the data and methods defined in service file easily
